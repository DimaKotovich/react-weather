# About
In this app, you can find more relevant weather forecasts in the city than you need. When the page is open, the app receives data of your location automatically, but for this, you need to enable the use of your location by the browser. You can add cities that you need by entering their names, also you can delete them. All the information is stored in IndexedDB, so all the cities that you added are saved. Relevant weather forecast data is provided by OpenWeather API. All the information is displayed on the page. If more than 5 cities are added, they will split into several pages.
